# Description
I did an independent study for a Barret Klien, a Biology professor at the University of Wisconsin La Crosse. He needed someone to create software using an Arduino that would be able to control the volume of 6 different speakers. These speakers would be attatched to the backs of sleeping pods that would contain sleeping Bees. Once the bees were asleep, he would use it to test the noise and vibration levels at which bees woke up at different stages in sleep. I helped him with this by creating a user interface with which he could adjust the volume levels for each speaker, as well as the communication between the application and the speakers themselves.
